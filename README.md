# dropcatch

I created a small collection of dropcatch bots, these are nice for dropcatching deleted domains (Works well with less contested domains 
that are not targeted by dropcatch.com and their 1000+ registrars)

Attached are 3 bots written in python:

namecheap.py - My original bot using namecheap's API to drop catch an upcoming deleted domain

dynabot.py - Another dropcatch bot using dyandots API, which is cheaper and faster.

4l.py - A bot to try and buy any available 4 letter domain on the market, using dynadots API

Feel free to use these, or message me/adapt yourself for support for different APIs
